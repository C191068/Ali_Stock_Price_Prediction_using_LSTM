This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of some leading companies, Apple Inc., Microsoft

Corporation,Google and Beximco Pharmaceuticals Limited using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 

recurrent neural network. Historical stock price data for both companies is loaded and preprocessed, and 

then scaled between 0 and 1. A time series function is implemented to create the input-output pairs for 

training the LSTM model. The model architecture consists of multiple LSTM layers with dropout 

regularization, followed by a dense layer for the final prediction. The model is trained using early 

stopping and a validation set. The training process is visualized by plotting the loss values. The trained 

model is then used to make predictions on the test data, and the mean absolute error is computed as an 

evaluation metric. The actual and predicted prices for , Apple Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Google and 

Beximco Pharmaceuticals Limited are plotted to visualize the performance of the model. This project 

demonstrates the application of LSTM recurrent neural networks for stock price prediction and provides 

insights into the accuracy of the predictions for , Apple Inc., Microsoft Corporation,Google and Beximco 

Pharmaceuticals Limited stocks, aiding investors and traders in making informed decisions.
